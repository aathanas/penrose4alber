# penrose4alber
Checking the Penrose stability condition for the Alber equation with given spectrum. Uses Weideman's rational eigenfunction method for the computation of the continuous Hilbert transform. References and demos included. 

Main function: CheckPenroseCondition.m (see in-file documentation)

Demo for Gaussian spectra: demo_Gaussian.m

Demo for JONSWAP spectra: demo_JONSWAP.m

References and extended description of the condition and the algorithm: Notes.pdf (./Notes.pdf)
